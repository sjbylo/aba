# Mirror registry configuration
#
# Examine all values carefully and adjust them to match your *internal/private* (air-gapped) environment!
# Set the values to either a) your existing registry, or b) where you intend to install the Quay mirror registry. 

reg_host=registry.{{ domain }}		# FQDN (domain) of registry. No IP addr allowed. Can be for this host or a remote host.
					# Ensure a *DNS A record exists* that points to the IP address of that host.
					# For a remote host, be sure ssh is working from this host to the remote host 
					# and set 'reg_ssh_key' and 'reg_ssh_user' (below) appropriately.

reg_port=8443				# The port used by any *existing* mirror registry. 
					# Note that Quay mirror registry appliance always uses 8443. 

reg_path=ocp4/openshift4		# This is the path where the OCP images will be stored,
					# e.g. https://registry.example.com:8443/ocp4/openshift4/...

reg_user=init				# Set your existing registry's username. Note that the Quay appliance username is fixed: 'init'.

reg_pw="p4ssw0rd"			# Registry password. Leave blank if a random password should be created e.g. reg_pw=
					# The password must be at least 8 characters and contain no white-space.

data_dir=				# Optional: Absolute Path to large data disk for storing images and temporary files. 
					# Quay is installed as $data_dir/quay-install & the oc-mirror cache as $data_dir/.oc-mirror. 
					# Default is the local (or remote) home directory. Note that '~' can be used after the '='.

# Important: The below 2 values are only needed if you want aba to install Quay on a remote host.

#reg_ssh_key=~/.ssh/id_rsa		# Optional: Ssh key file to use for *remote* install of Quay.
					# IMPORTANT: If undefined (the default) Quay will be installed on **localhost**.
					# The key must allow password-less access to the remote host (defined by reg_host above).

#reg_ssh_user=				# Optional: Username to use for *remote* install of Quay. Default is current user.
