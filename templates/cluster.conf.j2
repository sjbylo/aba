# This is the main cluster configuration file.  Please go through all values carefully and adjust to match your needs!

cluster_name={{ cluster_name }}			# Set the cluster name.
base_domain={{ domain }}			# Set the cluster base domain.
					# These will form the cluster domain, e.g. sno.example.com

api_vip={{ api_vip }}			# Set the OCP 'ingress' and 'api' IP addresses. Note that the values 'api_vip' and 
ingress_vip={{ ingress_vip }}			# 'ingress_vip' are *ignored* for single node OpenShift (SNO).
					# OCP installation prerequisite:
					# Be sure to set the two required A records *in your DNS server*.
					# For SNO, be sure both DNS A records point to the IP of the SNO node.
					# For non-SNO, ensure the records match the above IP addresses set in
					# the above api_vip and ingress_vip values. 
					# Example: 
					#   api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>     => ip of api_vip
					#   *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>  => ip of ingress_vip

machine_network={{ machine_network }}/{{ prefix_length }}		# Set the network CIDR for the cluster nodes. 

starting_ip={{ starting_ip }}				# All nodes will be configured with static IPs starting from this IP address.  
					# Ensure IPs are within the range of the above 'machine_network' CIDR.
					# Be sure these IP addresses are not already in use!
					# This will also be the IP of the agent-based rendezvous node (node0).

hostPrefix=23				# A hostPrefix value of 23 provides 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses per node. 
					# Set this lower, e.g. to 22 for more IP addresses, esp. for bare-metal servers. 

master_prefix=master			# Prefix names for masters and workers.
worker_prefix=worker 			# OpenShift nodes will be named: master1, master2 ... worker1, worker2 etc.

num_masters={{ num_masters }} 				# Number of master (control plane) nodes.
num_workers={{ num_workers }}				# Number of worker (compute) nodes.
					# Default (standard cluster) is 3 masters & 2 (or more) workers.  
					# Compact cluster is 3 masters and no workers 
					# Single Node OpenShift (SNO) is 1 master and zero workers.

dns_servers={{ dns_servers }}		# Comma-separated list of DNS server IPs, reachable from within the private network.
next_hop_address={{ next_hop_address }} 		# The private network's default route IP (optional).
ntp_servers={{ ntp_servers }}		# Optional: Comma-separated list of NTP servers. Configure NTP during bootstrap and
					# the installed cluster. Required if platform clock not synchronized!

port0={{ port0 }}			# Name of the port to use for the default network. 	    Example: ens1f0, ens3, eth0 etc.
port1={{ port1 }}			# Optional: Name of 2nd port to use if bonding is required. Example: ens1f1, ens4, eth1 etc.
vlan={{ vlan }}				# Optional: Vlan tag to use with or without bonding.

#int_connection={{ int_connection }}		# Optional: Set int_connection=proxy if you want to configure the 'cluster wide proxy' by reusing any existing shell proxy vars.
						# Set int_connection=direct  if you want to use direct access to the Internet, e.g. via NAT.
						# Set int_connection=none or int_connection= to use a mirror registry (default) which has been configured with "aba mirror"
#http_proxy=http://10.0.1.8:3128	# Set these three '*_proxy' vars to override (or if no existing shell proxy vars set).
#https_proxy=http://10.0.1.8:3128
#no_proxy=.example.com,.lan

ssh_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa		# Optional: Path to your ssh key pair files (recommended).
					# The public key (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) is copied to all OCP nodes.
					# The private key (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa) is used for ssh access to your nodes.

# All the below values are only required if VMware is used to create VMs for the cluster.

mac_prefix={{ mac_prefix }}		# If file "macs.conf" exists containing mac addresses, those addresses are used.
					# Otherwise, all VMs will be created using this mac address prefix. 
					# Be sure these mac addresses are not already in use!
					# To avoid overlap, 'x' characters will be replaced by random hex values. 
					# Note that if the target platform is bare-metal, the mac addresses can also be
	  				# manually adjusted directly in the 'agent-config.yaml' file (after running 'aba agent-config.yaml').

master_cpu_count={{ master_cpu_count }}			# Set the number of CPUs (cores) and Memory (GB of RAM).  
master_mem={{ master_mem }}				# For SNO, the minimum is 16 CPUs.
worker_cpu_count={{ worker_cpu_count }}			# Note: Only required for nodes based on VMs
worker_mem={{ worker_mem }}

data_disk={{ data_disk }}				# Add optional data disk (thin prov.). Leave data_disk undefined for 'no disk'.
