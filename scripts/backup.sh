# Usage: backup.sh [--inc] [--repo] [file]
#                   --inc	incremental backup based on the ~/.aba.previous.backup flag file's timestamp
#                   --repo	exclude all */mirror_*tar files from the archive due to disk space restictions.  Copy them separately, if needed.

# Notes on the above
# See the "tar cf" command below and consider....
# Note, don't copy over any of the ".init", ".installed", ".rpms" flag files etc, since these components are needed on the internal/private bastion
# Don't include/compress the 'image set' tar files since they are compressed already!
# Don't need to copy over the oc-mirror-workspace (or working-dir 'v2') dirs.  The needed yaml files for 'aba day2' are created at 'aba -d mirror load' (???).
# Don't copy over the "aba/test/output.log" since it's being written to by the test suite.  Tar may fail or stop since output.log is actively written to.
